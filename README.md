## Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to clean, analyze, and visualize survey data provided by the Edmonds School District. Our objective is to uncover trends, patterns, and exceptions within the data that can provide actionable insights to our community partner. The final deliverables will include visualizations that are not only accurate and informative but also visually appealing, with clear titles, legends, and data source information. These findings will be presented to the class during the mid-quarter review and to the Community Partner as a final presentation.
Questions

The data analysis focuses on the following key questions:

- Teacher Communication: "I know how to contact my student's teacher when I have a concern."
- Principal Communication: "I know how to contact my student's principal."
- Parental Support Confidence: "I am confident in my ability to support my studentâ€™s learning at home."
- Social Support Awareness: "I know who to go to if my student is struggling socially at school."
- Bullying Response Awareness: "I know who to go to if my student is being bullied at school."
